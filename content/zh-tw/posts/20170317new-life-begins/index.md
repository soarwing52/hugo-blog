Till this week, I'm in Germany for six months, not too long, but a lot

happened to my life This time, with the begin of the second intensive German

course, all the Erasmus routine began again, I think it's time to review what

I gone through in the past semester. -序章- 啟航 至本周為止，我已經在德國超過六個月啦，這半年說長不長，說短不短。

看著一切新的交換學生進來，繼續上寒暑假密集德文班，每天晚上的Party行程，就好像是時光倒流一樣。 也是到現在，我才有空回顧過去這半年、這學期。

From May I received the enrollment of Frankfurt, and the reject of Stuttgart

and TUM, I rejected to go to JEMES, joint European Master, which is one year

in Barcelona and one in Hamburg.



After the crazy administration through the whole July and August, finally I

arrived the airport with everything.



從五六月放榜，到七八月被德國在台協會的行政搞得昏天暗地之後，終於，可以收好行囊，踏上這"出國深造"的路途啦

On this flight, there are two girls sitting next to me, one is going to

Birmingham to study jewelry, and the other is going to London for working

holidays. Everyone with their own unknown future, this is a one way ticket!



  



三個座位，一位要去伯明罕念書，一位去倫敦打工度假，一位將落地法蘭克福，面對未知且陌生的國度，這是一張，單程機票



(其實應該也不算太陌生啦，在這國際化的年代)

My transfer flight is four hours, just enough to get a meal voucher here. I

chose an Arabic meal, of course! we are in Dubai!

This picture, is the last one I took before boarding to Frankfurt, and this

happen to be the IMG_9999  

what a coincidence, the coming photos start from number 1, just like my new

life will be.  

  

究竟，這是命運無情的捉弄…  

還是貪婪的慾望在作祟‧‧‧‧  

又或者是非善惡的因果循環 ?  

我的這張照片剛好就是編號9999，登上前往法蘭克福的班機，我的照片就這樣從1號開始

Now, grab my luggage, we are in Frankfurt now!



  



以上都是廢言，我很喜歡在飛機上看著大地，跟平常arcgis看的尺度相似，而且這個角度看到的，是一個概括了這個地區內涵的樣貌



  



我拍了很多張，不過，還是放在相簿中吧



here's the link to all the image on plane
