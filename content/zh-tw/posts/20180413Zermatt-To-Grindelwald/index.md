Ok, I survived and Andy enjoyed the first mountain, it's time to go to the

next one. The task today is ride down back to Visp, take the train through the

tunnel, and then bike to Interlaken, bike 18 km uphill to Grindelwald, our

hostel. So, shall we?

After saying goodbye to Rienie, we put on all our clothes and ready to face

the cold downhill!

After the tire was fixed, we came to Visp, get some food and packed our bike

So, the train ride was 20 minutes and 20 euros



we saw a gorgeous lake the second we came out, so we decided to take a detour

and surround the lake



its only 15 km more

And then we ride along one road just by the lake, small ups and downs



I just can't describe the color here!

Well, this day other than my crave for snowboard, I see the beautiful lake

here. I start to enjoy also because I got better after a one day break



though I'm still not completely fit, but I'm now confident to finish the trip!

no unnecessary train rides!



and sleeping at a host is so different, well, this is travel, different

conditions!



there was one Taiwanese guy in our room but he never talked to us, odd.



so, prepare for tomorrow, we are going to some young ladies!
