[](https://draft.blogger.com/null)Well, that is the European center bank, this

This story is really hard to start, because this is just too much to say,  

  

so just like the old story of all times.  

  

Once upon a time, there was one house called Adam-Opel 24  

  

It was built in the 1960s, used for old bachelors.  

  

There were so many cool guys living there,  

  

like Alex, who is always drunk and knocking on our door.  

  

and others heard from Dustin,  

  

like there was one guy called the phoenix, tried to jump and kill himself from

first floor  

  

once a black guy on drug and banged the kitchen.  

  

some fellows go in and out the jail frequently.  

  

A lot of old men R.I.P. in their room.  

  

so, the life here, I'm looking forward to it!  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Now to introduce my friends in this block.  

This is a block of eight rooms, with two double room. So that makes us ten in

this block.

  

401 is rented by one Vietnamese guy who never here.

  

402 is my room.

  

403 is Kamal, engineer student in our school. He's here already three years. A

funny guy.

  

404 is two Russian guys working here. They don't speak English nor German. So

it's hard to communicate. They often stand outside and smoke. I don't really

like that.

  

405 is two Indian tall guys. They used to held one India kitchen almost every

night. Usually makes a mess. Which kind of irritated others.

  

406 is Dustin. The American German, most of the parties and events were held

by him. His nickname is the prince, lol. When there is a prince, there will be

a king.

Where's the king? His moving out is why I get this room. Is a sad story but

I'll tell it later.

  

407 is Weby. Another Indian. Got this name cause his arms and legs are long

and thin.

  

408 is Enzel. He's 61 years old. His biggest hobby is to open his door and

watch TV with the sound loud.

But what does he watch? Porn. He has two screens, always one porn. Other can

be football games or somewhat.

  

These are the fellows living in this block. We share toilet, shower and

kitchen.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

Okay, I think I'll start with the story of the king. After all, he's the one I

can live into this place.  

  

He's the man who lives here for the longest time, 35 years.  

  

He came from Italy, a place "with 200 km coastline".He was a worker at the

company nearby.  

  

According to Dustin, he already got Alzheimer's disease when he moved in.

  

So he doesn't really remember what happened before that.

But he know everyone one in the building. And since everyone knows him, and

show him respect, he is the king of this building.  

  

When you really hug him you can feel the warm sun in his blood, he may not be

your grandpa, but he is definitely an old man everyone like.  

  

But actually it's really hard to describe, it's a atmosphere, which you can

only feel it.  

  

That's how this name came.  

The KING

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And who's next? Dustin.

  

He lived here for seven years. And enjoyed.

  

He's usually the party planner and holder.

  

He's American-German so we usually use English to communicate.

  

He is a good friend to the king, and he says he the prince of this block.  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

We had so many parties

It's all really cool and enjoy of life

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then, Kamal.

  

He came from India and study software engineering.

  

Usually he's home all the time.

  

At first he worked at a kiosk every weekend so he don't really have free time.

  

But he shows great support as a friend to our block.

  

He just turned 29 this year, we had a small celebration with one cool video.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Living in this house is really interesting.

  

Comparing all the student dorm and the house provided by the school, this

house is really cheap and nice.

Most my classmates are in the FDH, they don't have elevator and the room is

smaller.

We got one built in 1963, still functions.

  

Though most people here are Indian students, to meet other friend I need to go

for at least 30 minutes to the city, but it's okay.

  

The traffic here is only two tram, 11 and 12.

But they work perfectly, goes to school, Hauptbahnhof, Zeil without

transferring.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes we hangout in the house with some drinks and wraps.

  

We got Adam, Marie also live at this house.

But most of the people Dustin knows moved out.

It understandable cause it's only one room, most people will prefer live a

better place when they got the money.

Two Chris, Depak, Salva are the people we hangout together.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's the house, Adam-Opel.

  

The place I start my life in Germany.

  

I would say I'm lucky to be in here, though to keep sanity is really not an

easy thing in this insane house.

  

But I'm going to stay longer in this house, and cause I can keep it after

graduating from school.

  

And the fun of it, you need to create it. And it will keep creating more life!
