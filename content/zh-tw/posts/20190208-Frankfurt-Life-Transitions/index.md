Chapter Frankfurt:  

  

in this part of the story, I lived a different life, even for a student in

Germany.  

  

  

  

The house of Adam-Opel-Straße, is where it started, brings us happiness and

pain in the ass. And the reason my life can be such an adventure.  

  

  

  

  

  

But what can be carried out, it because of our community.  

  

  

  

FH, the Uni is the main reason but turned out to be the smallest part of this

adventure, we all studied, worked, loved and went on.  

  

  

  

Among the adventure, there must be a safe house, and my friends from Taiwan,

provided the calm and  

  

safeness, we were brought together because we’re here together in Frankfurt,

or else we’ll never get to know each other for we all are so different yet in

the same city. Nationally is only a name, but there’s somewhat in us made us

friends and family.  

  

  

  

For everyone been here, stayed, we all share some bond, the fact that we’ve

became together, I’d say, thank you all, for being in my life making it

better.  

  

  

  

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

  

  

Well, among the touching words, life is still a moving wheel.  

  

  

  

after the first week of office life, there are more words.  

  

  

  

So first introduce the daily in the office, usually starts around 8-9, ends at

17-18. With 15 minute breakfast and 30 minutes lunch break.  

  

and Friday people all leave around 13:00.  

  

  

  

Its quite a descent job for the first week, no technical issues in ArcGIS,

pretty familiar with the software and everything.  

  

  

  

Though the job is really basic, but I guess when doing location information,

the local database is always needed to be created.  

  

  

  

The atmosphere is quiet in the office, not challenging but getting use to an

all German working environment  

  

  

  

so far, good  

  

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

  

  

and the new place, its the first time I really stayed in a german WG, shared

apartment.  

  

everything is big and nice.  

  

  

  

the owner is a lady who lives with her mom downstairs.  

  

  

  

currently the roommates are a guy call Mohhamad, which I only seen once, a

german girl moved in the same day as me, and one Croatian couple, which is old

enough to be my grandparents.  

  

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

  

  

the quiet nights in this new room, there's much to think about.  

  

  

  

and also this is the time of Chinese new year  

  

  

  

something ends, something starts.  

  

  

  

in the past two years, every one just bypass each others life in this busy

city.  

  

  

  

the first year, kind of the first taste of new life here, trying everything.  

  

  

  

after the exchange, back here, and start to be more serious for the next steps

of life.  

  

  

  

and also because I'm not so into the Erasmus group and the german language

class classmates are less  

  

  

  

my friends became the Taiwanese around, and my Adam-Opel group.  

  

  

  

I had a lot of quiet time in my room back in Adam-Opel also, but this now here

is different.  

  

  

  

being more pragmatic now, facing what will be in front of me, and looking at

whos beside me.  

  

  

  

Allen once asked me if we do a film of the Franfurters of our friends, but its

kind of hard.  

  

  

  

we are all friends, we had fun together, but what will be the thing that bring

us more together?  

  

  

  

only same all are Taiwanese? yet we are still very different.  

  

  

  

so to leave a mark is kind of hard. So we end up making dumplings together.  

  

  

  

Its nice to have everyone around, yet after the meal, we all go back to our

own ways to our life in here.  

  

  

  

  

  

And for the Adam-Opel fight club, we had great times, and I believe we will

always be the same no matter how we moved,so I'm not worried at all.  

  

  

  

As I said, this is not the end, it's just one chapter.  

  

  

  

after this chapter, which characters will keep on showing up in the next, and

maybe who will jump back after a few pages, who knows?  

  

  

  

still, my attitude is stay open, and embrace what will come.  

  

  

  

Always I tried my best, or even always better than my best, and I can't afford

to worry about the result, it's just to overwhelming when I used all my energy

on my efforts.  

  

  

  

So, this chapter for me, is a reminder, a milestone, and a tombstone for the 2

years in Frankfurt.  

  

  

  

and this is also a message, for my friends, the moments were kept in mind, and

the future pages are still empty,  

  

  

  

invitation awaits here, who will be in the next page?
