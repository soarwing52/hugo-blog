After settle down, it's time to explore the surroundings!  

  

there are some beach around: Karapınar,Çeşmaltı, Balıklıova, Mordoğan,

Karaburun  

  

Till today, I've been to three places around,Karapınar,Çeşmaltı, and one Cesme

diving.  

  

  

Before the first beach, I went to the university to meet the Erasmus office,

and then go to Gülbahçe looking for the kite surfing rental.  



  



And in to the small village, one man shouted to me: where are you from? from

one tea shop.



  



That's all the English he knows, and I was looking for lunch place, but the

tea shop only got breads.



  



He seems to know that I'm hungry, so pointed toward one direction and told me

that I can go for it.

On the way two kids saw me and asked: Are you hungry?



  



And that's all the English they know. But they led me to one restaurant.



  



Luckily there is one old man speaks German, and he ordered for me.

15Lt one meal and cola, quite a good deal!



  



Unfortunately the kite-surfing place is not open.

So the first one is Karapınar. From Urla I take the minibus direction

Gülbahçe.  



  



After that, just hop of anywhere close! Well I just walk through one street,

and its the beach here!

It's clean but also a bit cold with the wind.

After two hours, head home.



  



\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The third one is Çeşmaltı, a coffee place nearby Urla.



  



There was one island I tried to visit but it's gated.

The music beach is quite nice but I don't know if I need to pay for the seat,

so I chose to lie on the sand.



  



More kids, families, but still enjoyable.



  



\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



And then I finally got in contact with the diving coach and got on the diving

boat.



  



Early bus to Cesme and then the whole day.



  



I'm really a beginner and the coach was disappointed.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Till here I really want to complain about the transportation here, like every

local does.



  



The minibus shakes like shit and the air in the bus is always a mixture.



  



Though I'm not able say it since I'm all covered with sand



  



It's really not a good thing as everyday use, but it's the only thing we got

here.



\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



And today I'm officially living in the room!
