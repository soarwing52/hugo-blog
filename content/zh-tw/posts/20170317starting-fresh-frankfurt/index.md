description: "Start everything from scratch- First week in Frankfurt"

With a bunch of unknown, I arrived this city, Frankfurt.  

  

This day, is September 13, 2016.  

  

歷史上的今天：九月十三，洪喆譯抵達法蘭克福。"我的一小步，是全人類的一大步"  

  

-每次都要附註：這完全是不負責任的描述與翻譯，完全不同步-  

  

  

  

All I know, is the Airbnb I found in the FB group of Taiwanese in Frankfurt,

and meet the professor on the next day.  

  

So I met the cute couple, who's the house owner, they are really friendly and

managed everything.  

They also came to the airport to get their aunt from Singapore.  

I explained what's the situation, that I don't know when can I move out, and

everything will be clear after I met professor Carolin.  

  

我在臉書社團上找到的房東來機場接機，真是太感動了，當然也是因為他們姑媽也從新加坡飛來，而且時間差不多  

然後呢，懷著一切未知，只知道明天去找教授，下禮拜開始上德文，我就住下來啦！  

  

This is my room

And after settled down, they kindly drove me to DM, Aldi for food, and invite

me to dinner.  

the owner, Kong, helped me on Anmeldung, the proof of staying in Germany, SIM

card, choosing the Telekom. And later he took me to Commerzbank and got an

acount quickly.  

  

房東很罩的幫我"入定"，不然我真的可以就地涅槃比較快XD 除了開車載我去買食物、sim卡，接下來的戶籍、銀行帳戶都很給力的幫我處理好了  

第一天，就慷慨的請我吃當地的餐廳，到今天我都覺得這家餐廳很道地，從整間店都是老人知道的XD  

  

來到德國，當然就是要從啤酒開始啦！

Well, since I didn't get my study chip, I need to pay for transportation, but

I got a bike from Kong, with the perfect weather, I went by bike everyday for

three weeks.

早晨出發，回頭望向我的房間，尖頂閣樓

bike, is in my blood!  

從房東獲得一台腳踏車，好像是19吋的車架，阿魯巴專用，坐管降到最低

I went to see the house I will live in, it is still renovating, I was told to

be available since October, three weeks.  

接下來我即將住進去的"傳說級"房屋，我當時還不知道。當時還在整修，因為原本住戶剛搬走不久，我運氣不錯才住到這間房間的，有他的特殊性。不過呢，一切等到十月我才能入住，一切才要開始。

well, some easy meals. the routine is go to school, come back around 3 with

desperate hunger. cook and eat only one meal.  

然後就是，清淡的食物...  

每天就是白天出發去學校，下午回來簡單煮一餐，吃大分一餐底兩餐，然後繼續搞清楚明天該怎麼做

This was the first week, before the intensive German course begins, try to get

all the documents done.  

It happens that I need to wait for everything for at least three weeks. Well,

I'll stay in this house for a long time.  

  

第一周，這樣簡單的了解環境，行政流程，然後就是，住這三個禮拜，然後呢，其他的才能開始呀。
