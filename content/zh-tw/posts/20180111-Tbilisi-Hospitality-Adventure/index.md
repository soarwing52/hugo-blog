In this Serie, it always need to start with our movie:  

  

The Kung Fu Pilgrimage  

  

Now we are in the third city, our path is quite steady, film, walk, film  

  

當然，整趟旅程的重點就是我們的影片，所以都是要用他來開場的啦  

  

第三站了，我們步伐穩健的拍著我們的進度，不過動作已經用完了  

  

連火影忍者八卦六十四掌都出來了  

  

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ODHexGPF04]  

  

  

  

We took the night bus and arrive in the morning. Of course, saving time and

money.  

  

The lady is so kind to let us in at 9 in the morning, and what she don't know

is that we stayed for 36 hours in her house with only paying one night, she is

so generous and kind.  

  

WE basically stayed super long in every house, but also this is the last house

we stay during our trip.  

Wait?! we just passed half of our trip right? Yes, the next bed we get is back

in Izmir.  

  

First, go to sleep, in Batumi there was no hot water, so at here I took

another cold shower because the hot water was all used up  

  

well I had a good sleep on the bus, and the cold shower made me so clear,  

so I just grab a bread I bought and had it with tea and my papers to read  

  

And first we went to one Chinese restaurant, well the chef is from Peiking  

  

it tastes not bad  

  

but still I like to eat when we share, but this time we order only for

yourself, kind of strange for me  

  

夜車省住宿錢又省時間，好吧，就是這樣，早上九點抵達  

  

因為沒人知道在哪下車，結果坐到終點站，又搭計程車回到住宿點  

  

房東小姐很慷慨的讓我們早上九點就進去，殊不知呀  

  

他根本是引狼入室啊 哈哈哈  

  

我們總共待了36小時，整個超扯，不過他十方慷慨大方，也沒有不情願  

  

然後，這也是我們最後一個住宿點，诶? 我們才過了旅程的一半啊  

  

沒錯，接下來都是睡車上，下一張床就是回到家以後的事了  

  

然後大家第一件事情就是補眠，由於我在車上已經睡得不錯，加上沖了個澡，冷水  

  

於是就抓起之前買的麵包，泡了杯茶，念文獻啦  

  

之後大家就決定去吃中餐館，廚師是北京來的樣子  

  

看起來有模有樣的，吃起來也不錯是真的  

  

不過這幫外國人，吃桌菜還各自點各自的，哀，硬要  

  

然後吃的時候超有隔閡，我們基本上幾乎分裂成兩團了，連吃東西都是有一道隱形的牆  

  

你的心有~ 一道牆~

看看這關公跟茶几

After the meal, it's again, you go, we film  

  

we looked around for good spots, but there's non around the river and the flee

market along it  

  

the paintings are nice though,  

  

so we change and take the cable car and go up.  

  

吃飽喝足，拍片啦  

  

河邊的跳蚤市場 其實我覺得這些畫還不錯滿有藝術細胞的  

  

不過不適合拍片，我們就轉去登高啦

So we went up to the Mtatsminda Park  

  

then here is where we shot our cover photo  

  

登頂之後就是拍了我們的電影海報啦  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/faf5a-4.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0e55b-4.jpg)

  

the view

Behind the scene

And also our levitation is on progress  

  

all all the jumps made me sweaty, and we don't have shower, so my clothes will

stink  

therefore I took them off  

  

我們有拍用跳躍照做成的影片，所以我每天要跳400次以上  

  

滿身大汗，避免衣服臭掉就脫了吧絕對不是因為我是暴露狂

don't enlarge it  

  

  

And night falls, we walk down, the television tower is by our side  

  

the giant Christmas tree is also good place to levitate, but with clothes.  

  

黑夜降臨，我們該下山了 電視塔顯得漂亮  

  

然後聖誕樹前，再跳，不過不脫啦

This night we had burgers, and then got some alcohol and played dancing games,

fun.  

  

next day, we go film more!  

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

We woke almost noon and had some bad food in Georgian kitchen  

  

and then we go for the mother of Georgia  

  

Basically its just walk, film walk  

  

本日又是一個幾乎中午起床的節奏，吃了一家等一個小時的小餐館  

  

然後就是走路拍攝走路的行程啦  

  

this is totally what we are doing

Jumping from day till night

Of course we are hungry, we ate three dishes per person!

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/6c89d-20171222_img_6431.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0161f-20171222_img_6431.jpg)

  

這邊的長得像包子吃起來像台灣水餃唷

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4d206-20171222_img_6432.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/b01a7-20171222_img_6432.jpg)

After the meal, we found they don't take card,  

  

So we ran to change money again  

  

the change we got the magnet Ossy always wanted.  

  

After that, we go back to the house.  

  

We waited from 7.30 for the rest of the group and they said they need to

manage something for going to Yerevan and also the ticket back to Trabzon  

  

But with no internet it was a lost of contact  

  

Actually I was thinking if they still not in contact until 10 maybe we just

ask the lady if we can stay  

  

And when the lady came for the last time saying if we still staying here, she

offers a good deal for 7, at the same minute Karolina messaged us  

  

it was so close that we decided to stay  

  

and then after a messy conversation and walking around, we hop on the van to

our next country!  

  

吃飽喝足結果餐廳不收信用卡，趕快跑到旁邊換錢之後，回家!  

  

我們準時回到了房子準備拿行李，不過另外一組人馬失聯了  

  

只有一個他們要去車站橋車票的訊息，而且去亞美尼亞的車子也還沒確定  

  

所以呢，我們等阿等，幾乎快要放棄，我已經在盤算跟房東殺價說三個人留在這裡的價錢  

  

而就在房東小姐最後一次進來問的時候，我永遠記得那個時間，9:45  

同時訊息就來了，說他們處理好了，我們差點就決定住下來了呢  

  

然後就在一直要走還是要留的掙扎中，我們最後還是上車啦，出發!  

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

結尾都是中文小婊時間  

  

基本上兩位弟兄都是跟著我走，因為他們基本上沒什麼旅行經驗  

  

平時也算是滿宅的，就是去上課、訓練、回家  

  

住在市區那麼久也很少到處跑  

  

但是這次我沒有準備，只好臨陣磨槍的看地圖走看看，當然回來發現很多缺憾  

  

然後就是地中海人講話很快又講不清楚，溝通越來越困難  

  

這也是為甚麼我逐漸不想大團體，麻煩，而且大老遠跑去另外一個不怎麼樣的城市  

  

只為了洗國家數，我沒有這種癮頭，我要的是真正走過看過  

  

兩位年輕的弟兄，年輕人終究是年輕人，很想多收集一個國家  

  

儘管那個城市已經知道普普通通，而且到了之後他們表示跟他們國家幾乎長的一模一樣  

  

加上我的護照在這些地方....真的很麻煩，一個要簽證，一個不承認，土耳其也在鬧  

  

亞美尼亞邊境的故事，下一篇再說  

  

今天真的跳了三個景，又拍了好幾段，整個就是很忙，我是整團體能訓練最足的吧XD  

  

下一站，最後一個城市 Yerevan
