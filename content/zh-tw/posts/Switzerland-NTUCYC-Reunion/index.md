And Andy's flight will arrive at 8:30pm, luckily the connection in Moscow is

tight but he made it We waited so long because the bike didn't show up, once

we even worried if the bike didn't made the transfer in Moscow. After asking

the counter, thankfully that it is only at another area special for big

packages. The host Raoul drove us back home and we had spaghetti, it is

delicious! This is a great start, even though we haven't check the condition

of the bike after the long journey, if its still in one piece. But, sleep

first!
