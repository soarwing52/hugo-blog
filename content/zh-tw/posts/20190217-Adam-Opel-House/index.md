Well well well, this is a house of stories  

  

two years in here, gives me a lot of adventures

The fridge and the microwave I got from friends, the fridge was unplugged with

food inside, they said: keep it if you want it  

so I washed it

I started this story in this article  

<https://soarwing52.blogspot.com/2017/04/adam-opel-strasse-room-of-king-

and_28.html>  

  

that was before I left my prints here  

  

and in the two years, people come, people left  

  

first is Kamal left for his job at 2017, while i was in Turkey  

  

and when I'm back, Dustin also decided to move out, and we made one of the

biggest party in the house  

  

there was a castle

and I'm the dragon

After that, we had two Christmas big dinner,

2018

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1e2e6-25d9bc32-89ab-4e6c-a667-1319497e57ee.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/72eba-25d9bc32-89ab-4e6c-a667-1319497e57ee.jpg)

this family grows  

  

we did many crazy things that other places wont even think of  

  

dropping a tower from the window?  

  

turning aisle into water slide?  

  

Well, the two years here, quite nice  

  

  

and of course, my last night

one night, two groups  

  

<https://soarwing52.blogspot.com/2019/02/chapter-frankfurt-one-step-of-

life_8.html>  

  

I said what should be said here, still, its not goodbye  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

this house, though I'm not like the 8.5 year Dustin, I also spent part of my

life here  

  

from this room  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8575f-img_0545.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2cfae-img_0545.jpg)

  

to this room  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8f8c4-img_5798.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3aed1-img_5798.jpg)

  

that's how my life started in Germany, this house gave me a start, a pressure

free space  

  

which there is basically no rules, to accept all the challenges  

  

I think, this is something worth remembering.
