Since I came because of my master course, let's talk about education.

Basically the feeling is that everyone is putting a lot of effort and time,

having a lot of pressure to achieve low standard results.

Not only in my experience, but also others.

Well mostly Erasmus students are just having vacation and fun in the exchange

semester, but here it's giving tons of quests, exams, and homework

If these things help, at least it's acceptable, but it’s not

  

  

—————————————————————  

  

Here I’ll just stay with my personal situation first

  

Wednesday morning: research seminar

  

This class is on the purpose of setting the basis of the Master thesis, the

literature part.

The content is teaching a book called “how to do a social research “

Well it’s acceptable to learn that, but again, it’s just basic 101

information, very general

When in a master program, the form, the structure, the content and plagiarism

should be taught clearly and be required

But it’s not.

And since there is a very wide range of usage of social research, the topics

are also depends on each students own instructor. So the function of this

course is just to let us create the first proposal.

But nothing is regulated or defined.

It’s worse than my bachelor reports.

  

And for the performance

  

The teacher sometimes cancels class and once even when everyone is already in

the classroom waiting

She just said:5 minutes. In WhatsApp,

another 30 passed

:Another 10

Eventually class cancelled.

And the classmates attendance was also low, once even only me came to class

alone  

  

And for instructing, four of us have completely different topics

Gis, Urban-rural Interface, regional Economy, sustainable development

So it’s impossible to know them all and instruct

So when not regulate the form, and no research direction instruction

This class is only letting us looking for research question on our own.

I can’t say it’s useless, even comparing to other courses, it helped.

But the low standard is just unbelievable

  

And one funny thing : the teacher has one habit

When she thinks, she kept her mouth open and generates an Aaaaaaa sound, Can

up to one minute.

  

Thursday morning: regional economics and development

  

At first I thought he is a professor who really teach something empirical.

  

But after the syllabus is changed, the whole class is awful.

  

There's just not enough time to produce one quality report, and also the

professor is not looking for one.  

  

But today its finally finished, I gave myself only 30 out of 100  

  

This atmosphere of losing motivation is among all the people in all

departments and I have not idea why, I even stopped my exercising habit  

  

For the afternoon, planning theory.  

  

I just found that the professor is a doctor of philosophy, no wonder I

understand nothing  

  

tons of reading every week, but I still read them all  

  

the way is to let 2~3 students present, and mostly it's just collages of the

sentences of the readings, and they just read it  

And its always too long, the teacher never explain much and want us to feel by

our self  

well, I really don't see anything out of the history of planning in US  

All the theories, it was worse than geography  

We are debating if we are science, and this is just social science and Utopian

versus developer  

All the questions lead to unknown.  

  

The final exam was made easy for the teacher didn't know if we understand or

not  

good call, because I don't know a thing  

  

And the last class is GIS, it is slow.  

  

Every Friday from 10~16, just pure nothing, it could be done in one hour for

me  

  

It introduced ESRI story map, arcgis pro, online and the license is useful  

  

And I gave a lesson for spatial data mining  

  

The worst thing is that so many times it cancelled first time at 12.30 am  

  

so I check every Friday before I leave  

  

and then it happened that he cancelled at 10, 30 minutes before the class

start  

  

Well it's worse for others from Izmir, just two hours for nothing going in the

horrible bus.  

  

To conclude, the semester here asked a lot from the students but the quality

is not regulated  

  

And all the universities are so busy that all people are overwhelmed by it  

  

For me? I kind of managed them well, too much time in the Urla with no wind
