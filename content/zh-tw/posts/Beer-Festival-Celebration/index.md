Well, I'm not a fan of crazy drinking events and I got the Asian flush, so I'm

not really suitable to drink also.  



But the Oktoberfest is one of the famous events in Germany, that's why it's

also in my bucket list.



That's why I chose to go for it.



  



既然慕尼黑啤酒節那麼有名，來到德國當然必須踩過一次，就讓我們出發吧

This time I travel with studifahren, an agency organize cheap ways to travel.

With sleeping in the bus reduce the cost of accommodation and time, and end up

wandering in the city like a sleepless zombie.



  



這次的旅行方式是學生旅行團，專門舉辦半夜發車清晨抵達的旅行，然後半夜再發車，清晨再回到出發的地方。



這種兩天不睡覺的行程，基本上在城市裏的時候就像是一個殭屍一樣的睡眠不足。



我個人是已經不想再這樣玩了，太累了



  



The schedule this time is 1 am at Hauptbahnhof, it's the first time I take a

long distance bus in Germany.



I arrived the station a little bit earlier, but just to found a messy dirty

place with tons of different people going to different places. And there's no

sign for the bus stop, so I just walk around and ask if anyone is going for

the same trip.



Fortunately, I found some others and we waited for the bus which delayed for 1

hour. We departed at 2.



  



一點在法蘭克福車站，我提早了一點到，然後email 上的地址是一個非常奇怪的地方，法蘭克福的巴士站就是一個黑漆漆的鬼地方



而且沒有站牌，看見各家巴士開來開去，每次都覺得很難搭車。



而我人生地不熟的，只好到處問問看誰是一樣的囉



  



最後誤點一個小時，兩點出發。



And going into the bus is also creepy, cause the last stop was Köln, everyone

is already sleeping, and in order not to disturb anyone and looking for a seat

is not easy.



  



But I end up sitting next to the door, and others are a group of seven girls

from Köln, they are all exchange students coming from various countries.



  



剛上車的時候也是非常緊張又害怕，因為從科隆就上車的人們都在睡了，不好意思打擾別人，但是車上各種行李，十分侷促。



而我後來坐在司機跟門旁邊的位子，有一個空位因為她們是一團七個科隆大學的交換學生，來自美國以及東歐各國。

So, I choosed to join them. They are so prepared that they even all got the

München outfit! It was so cool.



  



To be honest, I'm still shy during that time, everything is new, just arrived

in Europe, my English tongue is still growing back slowly.



  



他們快到的時候紛紛起床，換上了慕尼黑啤酒節的服飾，整個做全套的，太神啦。



  



So, we arrived at 830. They decided to go for a spot in the tent first. The

festival is like any German festival, but a lot of big tents set up by the

famous beer producers.



  



We finally found a place to squeeze in, and got a good tent.



And the journey of drinking from 9 to 9 begins!



  



八點半抵達慕尼黑，下車後考慮先觀光還是直接啤酒，決定先去帳篷佔位子。



  



其實除了各酒莊搭起來的大帳篷外，就是個一般的園遊會。



  



九點進去之後，保證讓你直的進去，橫的出來！



從九點喝到九點，我也是醉了

Well, 1liter of beer is 11euro, kind of expensive. But it is for the

atmosphere of the fest.



其實裡面物價很高，一杯一公升啤酒十一歐，根本貴翻天，但是為了這個節慶氣氛，喝！

One amazement is the waitress can serve ten beers at a time, super strong!



值得一提的是這裡的女服務生超猛，可以一次送十杯啤酒，完美展現德國鋼鐵意志的力與美



  



And before long people started to challenge to drink the whole 1 liter at

once. The drunken drive starts!



然後當然有酒就會出現神經病，開始了各桌挑戰一口乾。



  



The dude next to our table really shows the technic by covering his hand over

the cup and place the cup completely upside down and finished it! Wow!



旁邊有個貌不驚人的小哥，一手壓住杯口，直接倒扣在嘴上，咕咚咕咚直接就這麼乾了！

After one beer and some bread, it's around two. And we really want to have a

break.



第二輪喝完，今天只吃了啤酒加麵包，完全就是澱粉雙重奏，該休息一下了。

Some of us went out and walked around the fest at first but then the second

time we decided to go outside around the city.



一開始出去透透氣，後來乾脆跑到城裡面走走

Even though I've been to this city before, getting some fresh air and out of

the repeating music is still nice.



雖然慕尼黑已經來過，但是離開那個氣氛透氣真的好多了



  



Well, the Rathaus, park are like cliches, but I saw some FKK people at the

other side of the park. No, I'm not drunk, they are all naked!



公園裡面看到天體營，其他就都沒什麼了

Around five we went back and saw the people off from work and came. The night

is always young.



五點左右回來，已經需要排隊進場啦。



  



Around that time we have to wait in line to get in. While we're in, people are

standing on the chair and dancing.



當看到群眾都已經在椅子上跳舞，真是一起瘋吧！  

  



  



Well, this is the charm of fest and crowd? People just gone crazy.



所謂樹大必有枯枝，人多變成白癡，加上酒精就是集體耍憨的時間啦！



  



[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUoUAmsNHKk?rel=0]  



Our bus will come at 12, but we cannot do this anymore. We leave for MacDonald

at nine. After the exhausting day, we are all blank minded.



但是到九點真的受不了了，我們決定撤。儘管車子十二點才會來。



就看見一群神情萎頓的人在麥當勞呆坐。



  



After departure, we were all dead. I remember I arrived five at Frankfurt, and

have to wait 40 minutes for the s-Bahn to Kelsterbach.



上車之後立馬睡死，抵達法蘭克福還要等四十分鐘的車。



  



This day is the last day I'm staying there, I used my whole day to move

because it goes from complete west to the most east part of Frankfurt.



今天也是我搬家的日子，花了一整天，從西部跑到東部。



  



The night I arrived, with a bad shower, sleeping without any pillow or

blanket, I was sick for two weeks.



晚上在疲勞、水溫不定的浴室、空蕩蕩的床夾雜下，我感冒了。



  



Though I got a tough start at the new house, but the fantastic adventure will

begin, in the house of



  



ADAM-OPEL STAßE



  



This is a true palace! The story will begin in the next post, and keeps going

on!



  



雖然剛搬來的時候很艱苦，但是萬事起頭難。



之後就會知道這個地方到底有什麼樣厲害的人地方



生存在這裡本身就是一個冒險，敬請期待



王子與王宮，我的新房
