Finally my blogs are catching up.  



  



This trip is to celebrate Aylen's birthday.



  



We are going to Amsterdam!

We talked about this trip from January, and finally we set everything two

weeks before our departure date.



  

Who are we? we are Amstergang  

  

Abhi

It's already kind of late, so all the hostels are booked.



So we found the cheapest place is in Amersfort, a town nearby.



  



At first I'm thinking of going after soccer training, but this day is barbecue

day, so just enjoy the food and drinks.



  



After that, I packed up quickly and we all arrived Fdh around one.



  



And they're having a party! With our seniors.



People are just so drunk.



  



At three we received a message saying our bus will be late for one hour, then

keep on drinking!



  



Well, eventually we waited for it longer in the cold night, to almost dawn.

So we are now in Amsterdam! It's 12



  

I'm kind of hungry, fortunately, I'm prepared. Sandwich!

I have a dinner date with my friend William who study at TU-Delft, and we are

going to meet in Rotterdam.



  



The first day is to walk around in Rotterdam.



And the fun can be created by creative thoughts.

The market is what this city famous for, and we are hungry for the food here.

When we walk in this city, the harbor and channel is an important part  

  

So anchor is heavy

"Okay.. Then here it is"

Dinner is at a kantonese restaurant, really good. Because a lot of people

immigrated from Hongkong to this harbor city.

Some are even better for the portion is European size than in Hongkong, said

William.



  



After dinner, we go to our Airbnb.



  



It's a lovely couple, the wife is from Brazil!



  



Well, all the furniture in the house is really tall. I feel like a hobbit in

this house ( but the lady is even shorter, that's why they have one ladder in

the kitchen)



I sit on the toilet and my feet are hanging in thin air.



The sink of the kitchen is almost to my chest.



  



So, the next day!



With a nice breakfast, we head out.



It's lucky that today seems to be the day you buy a book and get free rides.

Wait for the train, Supreme leader

We arrived Amsterdam in the afternoon. We ate some random burger. Then we

rushed to the boat ride just to find its too late to start. So we just walk

around and head for the coffee shop (weed).



  



We walked through the redlight district and the China town and found it.



  



After one cake and one roll, we start to walk some more.



90 minutes later, it starts to function.



The magic shows.  

  

Everything was so nice, even the most normal walking is a great ride,

adventure of senses.  

  

It's really indescribable. I believe it's banned because it can make the world

so peace.  

  

But we made a wrong decision, go to have a pizza and drink kwak

This is the last nice photo that night.  

  

After the beer, everything got sooooo dizzy  

  

I swear I saw Devil and Death itself in the sky of that night.  

  

Another interesting experience is that when we are waiting for the train to go

back home  

  

As I closed my eyes and listen to the sound of train accelerating, and I can

feel the wind and the speed.  

  

When the speed is too fast for me to bear, I opened my eyes, then I was

whooshed back to my body.  

  

Fortunately I can control myself not to puke on the train.  

  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

The Last Day  

  

We set off

Instead of riding a bike in the crowded city, pedaling through the canals are

a better way to enjoy

Even the cup is made of ice



  



Nothing much to say, just another tourist experience place. But the theme and

movie is nice. You can totally tell by my face.

Now, All aboard! Let's go through the north pole!



Which in this summer all the ice will be melt and with the global warming and

maybe the current will also stop causing serious climate change, because all

the freezers we are using, like in this bar.

"Jay, go! Just do something."
