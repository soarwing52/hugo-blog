Half of my time in Izmir has passed, so I guess I should be aware and have

some feelings about the surroundings.  

  

In the class Advanced GIS is quite easy, but introduced me to some ESRI

products which I haven't got my hands on before.  

  

This time is the Story map, I think it will be a great tool for presentation

as a GIS user.  

  

So, please enjoy  

  

Fist is the [cascade story map](http://arcg.is/2gYe249)  

  

And also the [Journal Story Map](http://arcg.is/2h160aE)  

  

  

That is some basic use of story map and small walks around.  

  

And for blogs, I think the[ tour map](http://arcg.is/2h0H5Eo) could come in

handy.  

  

  

And this one was kind of my last blog [Exploring the beach near

Urla](https://soarwing52.blogspot.com.tr/2017/09/exploring-beach-near-

urla.html) and used in this story map.  

  

it's quite fun.  

  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

So, for the things besides technology? what did I learned here?  

  

Well even though I will write things not so pleasant here, but still I don't

regret coming here.  

  

As my moral, make every decision as yourself after ten years, will you regret

not doing it?  

  

If yes, of course do it. If no, well why are you still worrying so much.  

  

It saved me out of a lot of emotional suffers.  

  

So, as for everyday life, I'm used to not speaking any thing while going

around in Urla, the town I live.  

  

Though the fish selling guy is my friend now, but still I can't really

communicate with him.  

  

And every other shops. And also looking for the best way to draw money and

with card or cash.  

  

those small things filled all the small gaps of life, chores took more time

than in Frankfurt, and more tiring.  

  

And for school life, it's nice to be taking different lessons, the lesson mind

set is some how life in NTU but not as advanced, sadly. I can understand why

they do this but not agree with them.  

Classes are not always understandable, or too crazy.  

  

Research seminar, this is the third time I take courses to generate a research

question, though I'm still bad at doing this, I'm not really a researcher I

guess. But this seems to be the only class with a proper content as a master

course. Though the teacher has some issues of repeating herself. Last week I

had one individual class, to cut and finish her words and go to the next topic

faster is the task.  

  

Economic and regional development. the teacher seems nice and also have good

lecture skill, everything is loud and clear, still, it's not what I want. It

is talking about the ancient 1990s model and how to grow. The era of endless

growing is in the past, and all the things I stand for against.  

  

Planning Theory is til now the most confusing lesson. Every week the most of

the hard reading is from this class, and in the lesson, the question of the

professor is really hard since she digs in all the details of the terms and

phrases. And the answer is even more confusing, like is it even a sentence?

every word is correct but don't really have a answer. Just no idea what the

heck is all the history of the theories which brought to the disastrous cities

of the current US. I don't know since it was always criticized in the past

year.  

  

Advanced GIS, well not so advanced since I'm already an advanced user. I guess

it's automatic A if everything went smoothly.  

  

And then classmates, well it seems now I'm the Charlie and three angels, the

sidekick of the DEU group. But it's fun. And among the classmates, hmm English

speaker is really rare, but still I had good friends I can give credits for

this.  

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

Outside of school I guess I'm stuck at Gulbahce, Urla surf house.  

  

I really enjoyed there, the kiting is fun. And kind of the only place I can

speak with people pleasantly.  

  

When there's wind, I want to go, when there's no wind, nothing much to do.  

  

The owner of [Urla Surf House](https://www.urlasurfhouse.com/) Nico is the

best guy in the whole Izmir time I met, he got soul, and kindness of helping

me and offers me all kinds of kite styles, he like to see kiters improve and

he kites with freedom.  

  

Strongly recommend to come to this place and enjoy the wind.  

  

And how about the free diving course?  

  

Well til today there's three days on the boat, yes, only three fuckin days,

from September.  

  

And ALWAYS on windy days. The lessons are less progress. One indoor class took

place last week, and it was turkish. The student who translates for me is not

doing a good job, but I can't blame him.  

This Sunday there's another session, and also, Sunday is the only windy day in

the following week, damn.  

I was looking forward to learning but the progress and the coaching just kept

letting me down.  

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

For the friends I know in Izmir? everyone is really friendly and nice. I can

really count on everyone of them. They always offer help and ask if I need.

And actually I really need them, I feel useless when nothing works out when I

try to do anything, just frustrating, the bond between people is the best in

here.  

So, let friends help, and also a good reason to hangout, and grab a beer,

turkish coffee, cay(tea), is always so enjoyable.  

Friends here are more hanging out, comparing to the endless partying in

Frankfurt.  

So I quite enjoyed when there's friends and really cherish the moments.  

Though still mostly the moments are the lonely Urla townsville.  

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

This blog is kind of the murmuring of the life here so far, I like some part,

hate some part, complicated just like life itself.  

  

I just have to keep going on and see where I go.
