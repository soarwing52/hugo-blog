This is the first overnight with the ESN in Izmir, and we had a blast.  

  

One week ago was the boat trip, and this time is to the famous Pamukkale.  

  

With sun and rain, we all began

Because I live kind of far, in the town Urla, so my bro Ada helped me crash in

their house in Şirinyer.  

  

With all the deu students, foreign and local, we had a chilled night.  

  

and the next morning, it's time to hit the road!  

  

In the bus is mainly the show time of our man, Adriano with endless power.  

  

After a long ride, we stopped a lot of toilets, and finally, we had our lunch

at 3

And then is the first stop, Salda salt lake



  



We were worried about the rain just happened, but even though it's cold, but

the rainbow comes.

Jumping into the lake is actually not that cold, and the water is sweet.

with 5 hours of bus ride, we stopped here for 20 minutes.



  



We saw Pamukkale on the way to the hotel, first insight, paragliding.

and then, the hotel.



  



The hotel is really the spotlight of the trip, where I enjoyed the most.



  



We have two thermal pools, one swimming pool and a bunch of crazy people!

It's really a fun trip and I enjoyed it, though I had a cold after that and

having constant fever during my first week of school.



But it's worth it.
