Ok, yesterday was painful, I hope today my knees will heal, just like the

Wolverine I was. Unfortunately, not. We changed our bike so I can ride easily

with road bike. Today, we are going to the mountains!

This is Lady Odile, our host

Of course I need to warm up before going, for my broken knee

Always fix the disk brake

We biked first Sion Sierre and then Visp It's all the way flat, we still

followed the bike lane sign a bit, the view is nice but sometimes it goes to

offroad and not fit for the road bike

Every 30 minutes to one hour my knee broke down, and I need a break, it's like

I can't use it for more than 100 watt or it hurts like hell, I feel horrible

Finally we arrived in Visp main station, it's three o clock

We first buy the swiss half price card

And yet I still want to try to bike up, and it turned out to be a great but

painful decision.

SO, LET'S RIDE!!!

It's flat at the beginning

And some donkeys are laughing at us dumb asses

Around 900m altitude it's the snowline, and there's a new accomplishment

Biking in the snow!!

The train is so tempting, but just something push me go up and up

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3ef41-img_5246.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/b5cb5-img_5246.jpg)

I tried to ride a bit, but I did a rational decision, walk my bike

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e13b6-img_5250.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8d954-img_5250.jpg)

yet still I'm dead

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7d764-img_5237.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c6a95-img_5237.jpg)

Finally the end has come, Taesch, the town where cars can drive eventually to

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1b5a9-img_7692.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9663e-img_7692.jpg)

But still there should be 8km to Zermatt, so we followed the road, and it ends

here because of snow

For this picture there is also one story, we found one pedestrian walk by and

ask her if she can take a photo for us, and she replied that she only speaks

German. Perfect! My language skill is trained for this! Asking strangers to

take pictures for us! So this is how this photo been shot.

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c1c52-img_5264.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/122a6-img_5264.jpg)

so we had to take the train

The Zermatt Shuttle

I am totaled

And now we are in Zermatt!!

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e7255-img_5287.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d8585-img_5287.jpg)

Our host Rienie offered us the first drink, actually I'm too exhausted to

enjoy a beer, I drained everything, all my strength to push me to this high

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d3eb5-img_5288.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c16d3-img_5288.jpg)

And for dinner, Rienie made fondue, my very first swiss fondue!!

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/17872-img_5291.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/10a6e-img_5291.jpg)

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dc37d-img_7707.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/13c8e-img_7707.jpg)

I'd love to chat more because Rienie is a great friendly host, but I'm just

having fever and at the edge of collapsing, so I went to bed earlier after the

"La Bomba" he offered us, he said it's good for sickness.

I felt so warm, not only because the shot was hot and strong, but also having

this help at my weakest night throughout the whole trip.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This day is one of the ride I want to do the most in the whole 9 days, biking

uphill is something I really craved for a long time.

At the beginning of the day, the first 60 km to Visp, I really thought I'd

have to take the train up, and maybe the whole trip will be a disaster, I was

so frustrated.

Thanks for Andy who switched bike with me, gave me the chance to succeed the

day.

And for some reason, my knees don't hurt so much the second I start in the

mountains, I felt better!

before a 2% would kill me, but now a 4% 6% is not?!

Though I still need to take a break more often than before, and I roar from

the bottom of my soul for pain, but still, I made it. I don't know what kind

of urge or magic is that, I just want to do this, and I did.

All I remember is feeling the body condition and control the amount of effort

I can give, and then more power came! It pushed me all the way up, though my

heart is pounding, my knees are cracking, my thighs are burning, but my mind,

carried it through.

We will stay two nights with Rienie, tomorrow will be no biking, just going to

Matterhorn sightseeing.

I slept with a strong fever, good night.
