For Spring break, I did climbing, Amsterdam, but it's just not enough.  

  

So for the Adam-Opel Gang, we are doing something wild!  

  

This time we arranged camping trip.  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/29562-img_6520.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/b129b-img_6520.jpg)

  

At first it could be a big group, but eventually it end up with only Dustin

and me.  

  

But it's still okay, nothing will turn us down!  

  

For the tent, I borrowed from my friend from climbing, Ronja.  

  

And then just go to Karlsruhe!  

  

well we booked almost everything at the last moment, the tent place are almost

all booked for it's Easter  

  

Actually we also had some confusion by searching, google is helpful but cannot

do everything for us.  

  

So after arriving in Karlsruhe, we still need to go to the area of hiking, and

Dustin wants to walk there, it's 50 KM just to be clear.  

  

We went to the tourist center and ask, "How do we go to Pfalzewald? "  

  

The lady looked at us in a funny way, and said, "Do you two young fellows know

how big of a region you're talking about?"  

  

Well it's the biggest forest protection area including Germany and France in

Europe.  

  

So after showing the camping site, we still need to take the regional train

and go the a small town.  

  

And here we noticed how this system of hiking goes. It's a long way including

13 camp sites, which people can walk from number 1 all the way to 13. but we

are only going to stay two, 4 and 5.

We go cross the river, over the road, and under the bridge.

And start our road to the Pokemon Master  

First one, goat  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e0065-img_6537.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/b9eb1-img_6537.jpg)

And after a break, let's head for the mountaintop!  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/56802-img_6538.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/96d3a-img_6538.jpg)

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/aad7c-img_6545.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/27b32-img_6545.jpg)

At the mountaintop are some rocks, as this monkey learned some dangerous

skills, now it's your time to shine!  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fd5b9-img_6557.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/971f9-img_6557.jpg)

And for my civilized friend, congratulations, you are a man

OK, now quit the jokes and stop fooling around! we are on a mission!  

  

quiet, and let's go for it, one shot, one kill  

[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkDCCMLjShg&w=320&h=266]

  

And like this one, we climbed up it

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/52d4b-img_6612.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e81e5-img_6612.jpg)

And the road of a geographer

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71229-img_6616.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d1e43-img_6616.jpg)

img_6627.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/13dd2-img_6627.jpg)

  

We also met some mountain bikers  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cf7ac-

img_6625.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/814c3-img_6625.jpg)

now, let's look at the sediment rock, there recorded the story of this land  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/580ad-

img_6633.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/35bcf-

img_6633.jpg)

This place could be a lake before

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/77aa5-img_6634.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/10b5f-img_6634.jpg)

the erosion also took place

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d2e7b-img_6635.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ad3a9-img_6635.jpg)

of course there will be a monkey around

  

That's quite the first day of hiking. And we reached the camping site.  

  

Set up the tent  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0be52-img_6643.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/b6d8c-img_6643.jpg)

  

make dinner

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/176ca-

img_6645.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a77bb-

img_6645.jpg)

  

and we met one guy with a dog here, we call him Mr. Egghead (Well actually

he's Sascha or so,but we forgot)

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d783d-img_6653.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/f79d4-img_6653.jpg)

  

the first night by the fire, nice and coldy(not cozy)

  

The slow motion really made the fire looks amazing

  

[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbO49VEwkag&w=320&h=266]

But what more amazing is, the marsh mellows we brought!

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/6fa73-img_6662.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/6d43d-img_6662.jpg)

  

For this night, I found that I made a mistake, we should go to 5 first and

then 4, but we are now at 4 already, so we'll go to 5 tomorrow.

  

And one other thing, from the camping site, only 30 mins walk, we arrived one

gas station and can buy beer and cola, near the town we began, so what's the

whole day walking for!!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 02

  

We cleared all up, and said goodbye to Mr. Egghead, and head north!

  

collect water

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d3a43-img_6663.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/35c90-img_6663.jpg)

walk through one factory fence

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ee006-img_6664.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e7af9-img_6664.jpg)

  

And got more to explore!  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ebf0e-img_6672.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ce76d-img_6672.jpg)

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0ec71-img_6674.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/60ec6-img_6674.jpg)

More of the poser pictures, actually they are just few inches from the ground.  

  

And this one is not monkey anymore, it looks like a gorilla, or black ape  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8de0f-img_6712.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/52ff3-img_6712.jpg)

  

back to the track, to drink or not to drink  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4826b-img_6720.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/6fd9f-img_6720.jpg)

And getting higher  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/113a1-img_6721.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0af3f-img_6721.jpg)

Guard!  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2f066-img_6726.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4bc2f-img_6726.jpg)

More mountains  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4171c-img_6733.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/24784-img_6733.jpg)

  

And we reached a high rock!  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/f99ca-

img_6735.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e6ba2-img_6735.jpg)

We can see the fear of the human instinct, the height.  

  

After that, we keep moving on, and found a cave man.  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8d242-img_6750.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/76d11-img_6750.jpg)

  

We tried to exchange some shiny things with him, be he's just not accepting

it.  

  

And he seems to write down today  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c64fd-

img_6752.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9ad1e-img_6752.jpg)

And now, more posers  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9fd10-img_6765.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2b050-img_6765.jpg)

Beware my wraith! I got the power!  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c66a6-img_6780.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/86aaa-img_6780.jpg)

  

  

and then we walked long for the camping site.  

  

the last few km is onto one steep slope, and we don't want to follow the path,

instead we cut through in the middle.  

  

I released my animal instinct and rushed up to the top, Dustin needs to

protect his beloved stick and is slower.  

At the top, there was one kid saying," Hey mama, the is one coming out from

the bushes and look there is another one, he's slower!"  

  

Dustin swear to God he want to kill that kid at that time.  

  

We were all exhausted at the top, but the view is a reward.

Great bros!

and then, dinner!  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/40c6d-img_6868.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/41453-img_6868.jpg)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

And now it's time to say good bye to the woods  

  

the last day  

  

Mr. Dustin, say goodbye to the stick helped you, in good times and in bad, in

sickness and in health. for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in

sickness and in health, until death do us part.  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3aa37-img_6882.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/78d9f-img_6882.jpg)
