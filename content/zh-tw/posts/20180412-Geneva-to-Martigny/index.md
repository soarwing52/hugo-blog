Again, first thank our host at Geneva, Raoul Today we are going from Geneva to

Martigny and pass the Castle Chillon This is our route

> #### [Relive 'Geneva-

> Martigny'](https://www.relive.cc/view/1496496687?r=embed-site)

First, we need to open the box and see if there is any surprise, if the bike

survived the journey

So we found that one screw on the brake is missing, thank god we are staying

with a fellow biker Raoul found some and we can hit the road, or else it will

be a problem especially when it's Easter holiday thank you warmshower! we need

some screws or we are screwed

Raoul also biked a biked with us, gave us a small tour

We said goodbye at the big fountain of Jet d'Eau

After that we followed the bike lane wandering in the small towns, but

actually this led us to a lot of extra kilometers, after few days we just

follow the road and ignore it. It went pretty well, we sat at a fountain in a

small village for lunch, well, just some snack bars and cookie This is our

biker face, it will be worse everyday

not long were we at the boarder

There are some beautiful mountains across the lake

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20c1b-img_7672.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a7810-img_7672.jpg)

But also, toward the mountains in front of us, let's ride!

And it's now time to go back to Switzerland

A boarder with no boarder control, easily pass through

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4d7c3-img_5140.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/32116-img_5140.jpg)

And keep on the ride

But I found my disk break is squeaking, well it's always a pain in the ass, I

still like the v-brake better

After we fixed it at a super windy roadside, we hit the road some more bike

lane along the stream

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a0a4e-img_5146.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3b948-img_5146.jpg)

Cross a bridge

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2d909-img_5142.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d3544-img_5142.jpg)

And we are at Castle Chillon!

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9d94d-img_5154.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/04c3d-img_5154.jpg)

We had the chance to take the train at here, or else it's another 40km, it's

already 106 here though my knee is under great pain for no reason, I insisted

to ride there with strong will and a lot of breaks, around every 30 minutes to

one hour I need to rest and sooth the pain

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/b0ad1-img_5157.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7fd47-img_5157.jpg)

but it's worth it! We arrived in Martigny around 7!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tonight we stay with an old lady from couchsurfing, she is a botanist who

speak little English. I asked everyone around here, only another girl said she

might be at home if the weather is bad, or she will be in the moubtains But

I'm very grateful that this lady gave us shelter even we can't communicate

well. What I do is bring a postcard of Taiwan and gave to every nice host as a

gesture of thankfulness So yesterday we had the host cook for us, but today is

not that lucky, we will have to cook She let us use the kitchen but also check

if we are burning it down Just pour the whole pack in!!!

So this is our first day on the road, long distance, 800m ups, but no big

mountains My knee was in pain with no reason for gods sake. I'm really begging

that the bike trip I hoped the most don't be in this kind of back condition

I'm a little bit sick also one day before this trip, everything I don't want

is coming. just please, give me nine days, and I can die in Frankfurt, or even

Zurich, just let me make this happen!
