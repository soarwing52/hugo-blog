Finally, it's our last stop: Yerevan  

  

Its only 24 hours go and back, stay in Yerevan for one day  

  

最後一個地點，亞美尼亞  

  

一日往返的快閃行程  

  

And our film:  

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ODHexGPF04]  

  

Last time ended at we enter the van,  

  

so we drove to the border, I slept  

  

when we are at the gate, actually this time took like 10 minutes and they let

me out, I guess it's easier to get out than get in  

  

but when we were entering Armenia, well, I need a visa, but I know that I can

apply and get it right away so I didn't do the online visa, hoping I have a

chance to get pass for free  

  

Unfortunately not  

  

and they kept saying that China citizen can go free, and well, I'm from Taiwan  

  

I can be a Chinese this time, can I go?  

  

but our guide is so kind that he paid for me.  

  

And then we went back to the van, and I kept sleeping.  

  

我就一路睡到邊境，離開格魯吉亞海關果然又卡住了  

  

不過這次大概十分鐘解決，大概是因為離開容易進來難吧  

  

進亞美尼亞的時候，他們表示，中國人不用簽證唷 台灣人要 大概講了十幾次吧  

  

好吧，我這時候可以當一下中國人沒關係，我可以進去了嗎?  

  

不行嘛  

  

不過可以落地簽，很方便，原本想僥倖的沒辦法~  

  

而且隨車翻譯還很大方的付了這個錢 好像是3000吧 大約6鎂 忘記了 現在也懶得查  

  

過關之後，我繼續睡覺  

  

  

For some reason our van is always at one of the most dangerous border in the

world

我們的位置一直處於南北韓交界是怎樣 這樣太危險~

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/f8d8e-20171223_img_6441.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c1a71-20171223_img_6441.jpg)

  

Suddenly I was woke up by the cold, I found we were in the middle of

nowhere,and the van door is open.  

  

I just kept sleeping  

  

yes, I did.  

  

It was 3 o'clock, what should I do  

  

as what I heard is that our van broke down, and they called another one  

  

we could have been in great danger, but I wasn't aware of it  

  

Karoline was saying that she was so afraid and she's thinking, ok,  

  

Ossy is big and strong, Tomas can do Karate, and Jay is sportive and maybe he

can do Kung-Fu.  

We stuck there about one hour I guess, since I was sleeping always.  

But actually if they want to rob us there's no way we can get away, they will

be definitely prepared.  

  

but fortunately we made it. At 7 we arrived in Yerevan  

  

當然回到車上繼續睡，睡著睡著，奇怪，怎麼這麼冷  

  

發現車門是打開的，管他的，繼續睡  

  

後來聽說是我們的車拋錨了，他們呼叫了另外一台來救援  

  

我們的波蘭小朋友說他整個都很害怕，然後不斷告訴自己，恩，我們有一位高壯的立陶宛弟兄，另外一位立陶宛弟兄會空手道，然後台灣弟兄很運動，說不定會功夫  

當然如果真的是搶匪我們是沒救的，因為他們絕對會是準備好的  

  

好險，我們七點安全抵達  

  

To pay the driver, we draw cash, wow, its BIG money

超大面額，支付車資7000

The weather forecast today? RAIN  

Lonely tourist  

  

十二月二十四日，天氣陰偶陣雨  

我們孤獨的走在清晨的廣場，淋著雨  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d1552-20171223_img_6445.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7022a-20171223_img_6445.jpg)

  

Christmas, new year is coming, but we are cold, hungry, and tired

歡樂的新年、聖誕都要來了，我們在這裡飢寒交迫

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/f1fab-20171223_img_6446.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bc791-20171223_img_6446.jpg)

  

we walked to the center and rest in one cafe, the only place open  

I changed, brush my teeth and had an easy shower in the toilet #homelessstyle  

早餐，義式咖啡廳的早餐...  

好吧，在廁所簡單梳洗，就像是流浪漢一樣，只是在高級廁所 ㄏㄏ  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ee40a-20171223_img_6447.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20fe4-20171223_img_6447.jpg)

  

Because they think the van is too small and they want to look for other

transportation possibility, even though the three biggest guy of the group

were sitting in the smallest last row of the van.  

We went to the bus tour company, they don't have a cheaper, better option  

So we put our bag at their office and also used their WIFI to ask the same van

took us here to take us back tonight. They are just so generous  

  

我們的地中海人士嫌車子太小，說需要一台大點的車，所以我們找了火車，跟客運公司，  

結果火車超級久又不怎麼樣，聽說很落後  

客運公司也說我們只能給你們包車服務(結果價錢比我們找到的貴  

所以我們就把行李放在他們那裏，用他們的WIFI跟載我們來的司機說一樣回去  

繼續厚顏無恥的運用大家的慷慨  

  

The weather is not good so not much to see

天氣因素，我們沒什麼拍照片/影片

this is kind of magical, thats why we shot our best scene of the movie here

(hint: minute 15)

霧濛濛~ 這樣的神秘感，讓我們有拍本片"高潮"的靈感(提示:第15分鐘)

本日特別免費的白蘭地博物館，當然去參觀

Theres one Christmas market nearby in the city center

聖誕市集~

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1a1f4-20171223_img_6473.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1d599-20171223_img_6473.jpg)

  

We went for pizza after we meet again at 17:00

五點我們再度會和，然後去吃披薩，這邊披薩市厚片美式啊!!

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/87d40-20171223_img_6478.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/870af-20171223_img_6478.jpg)

After that, we walked around waiting the van which will arrive at 12  

Just the opposite of Cinderella  

  

於是我們到處閒晃等待12點南瓜變馬車，喔不是，是我們的車來  

  

When the night falls, you know what will happen, the hospitality!!  

又發病囉

The famous square

萬、佛、朝、宗

And then its 24 hours of transportation, we arrived Tbilisi at 5.30

  

we are just like homeless looking for shelter

  

We first stayed in a cafeteria, and was swept away at 7

  

and then went to one restaurant, which we need to change more Lari for the

food

  

A TURKISH BISTRO damn, in Georgia still Turkish food

  

at 10 we started 12 hours of bus to Trabzon, I was really worrying if the bus

delay we will miss our flight, because the bus should arrive at 9, our plane

is 10:55, the last bus, which arrived Batumi delayed for 3 hours, this one

distance is longer.

  

But in this 12 hours I finally finished all my readings for the presentation

on the upcoming week!

  

We arrived the airport at 9:45, 45 minutes delay, but safe!

  

We still have time to shot some scenes.

  

And then 2 hours of flight, and then bus-taxi, we arrived our bed at 2.

Finally!

  

BTW going back into Georgia took only 5 minutes, and going out 10, nice!

keyword: residence permit of Germany

  

上了車之後，我們24小時的旅程即將展開，首先，我們5.30回到Tbilisi

  

然後呢，像流浪漢一樣到處找棲身之所，在一個沒開的餐館裡面睡了一個小時被打掃阿姨趕走

  

然後去了賭場、餐廳，都不收信用卡

  

最後跑到一家土耳其快餐店，馬的竟然來到這邊，土癌繼續蔓延

  

好吧，結果還是我去換錢讓大家有東西吃，大家都累到不想動

  

吃飽之後撐到10點上巴士，12小時後抵達Trabzon機場

  

一路上我十分擔心，因為上次光是到Batumi的車就誤點了三個小時，這次預估抵達時間是9點，我們的飛機是10:55，誤點超過一個小時我們大概就再見了

好險9:45抵達機場，小誤點，安全

而且我把該讀的文獻終於讀完了

  

我們還拍了幾段短的影片，吃點東西，上飛機，一點抵達izmir, 公車+計程車，兩點抵達溫暖的床 阿斯

  

而且我的護照又過關了，這次滿快的! 5分鐘&十分鐘 只要我說有德國居留權就可以過關啦

  

  

The film is in the can! And we got fans already!

殺青啦! 馬上就有粉絲，超讚!

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

Actually it's not the end of the trip for me, another 2 hours back to Urla,

finally I can go back to rest? no, studies, IYTE life is shit.  

  

This trip is really fun, I haven't have this kind of fun for a long time,

thanks to Hospital team  

  

Well we separated all the time, but it's for the film and also we enjoy more

than going just sight seeing.  

  

Still, without the help of Adriano, Nagore, and Karoline, we can't do this. So

I'm really appreciated.  

  

There were some conflicts also, but it's one part that will happen in all

trips, but we are still good friends, that's great.  

  

Special thanks to:  

  

A tree on the road  

bottles of water  

Ice in the square  

  

for all the effects in our movie  

  

By Hospital Team  

  

這次的結尾小表有寫英文，所以冠冕堂皇一點，瘟腥趕人  

  

兩點睡了一下，我起床還得再搭兩個小時車才回家，回家做什麼呢?  

  

當然不是休息，準備報告，這周有三個報告啊，[土癌就是土癌](https://soarwing52.blogspot.com.tr/2018/01/blog-

post.html)  

  

總歸而言，這趟旅程很爽很好玩，真的，能這樣瘋，很久沒這樣瘋了  

  

基本上我們一直都小團體行動，但是沒辦法這是因為我們在拍片  

如果要我們跟著逛景點，我們會很無聊的  

  

但是還是得靠這些人我們三個才能這樣無憂無慮的拍片  

  

當然沒有完全無憂無慮，這趟旅程有很多嘈雜的聲音，小衝突  

我這次當壁上觀，跟著小朋友們的規劃走，然後還要常常出來carry一下  

當然沒有大聖翔旅行社的等級，但是沒有想到他們搞的效滿多的  

連我都可以carry  

年輕人終究是年輕人  

  

而且老是在逛城市，回來才發現格魯吉亞根本超美，如果進去山裡面的話，整個禮拜在雪山裡面我都願意啊  

  

可惜，下次不知道什麼時候進去  

我們義大利旅行社，我一直沒有跟是因為逛景點浪費我的時間跟金錢  

所以這次是因為我們發病有影片才一起的  

  

最後，特別感謝  

路邊的一棵樹  

灑的到處都是的水  

廣場上的冰雕  

  

沒有你們我們的電影拍不成的啊  

  

這次結束之後，土國，終於要結束了
