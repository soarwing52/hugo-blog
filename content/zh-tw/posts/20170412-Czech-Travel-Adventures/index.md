桃努斯登山健行遊

Actually before the three trips, we also go on some events in Frankfurt held

either by the exchange student office or the EMA.  

其實這篇是序章，在真正三次旅行前呢，我們還有一次交換學生辦公室主辦的登山

This one is the hiking trip to Taunaus, the only mountain nearby.

桃努斯山就在法蘭克福旁邊，搭車就可以到

The one I can found to get some hills so far.

附近沒什麼坡 這附近大概就六百多而已

It's an early Saturday morning, great weather, we met at Hauptbahnhof. Always

the Starbucks.

週六早晨，我們永遠都是在星巴克集合

  

We take S5 and then U3 to the end.

  

And then it's hiking time!

  

搭地鐵之後，就出發吧！

It's not really steep and wild, but still the condition is a lot better than

the concrete path in Taipei. Though Taipei really got lots of great mountains.

What a pity.

這裡基本上山又大又平，但是比起台北的水泥登山步道，好太多啦

只能說台北還可以加強對於步道的看法

My blood bursts when I saw mountain bikers! I can't calm the eager to come

next time for it!

Well, it ends up with flat tire, in another post.

看到許多登山車在這裡，當然就是熱血沸騰的時候啦！

前篇我也寫過，後來在這裡以爆胎收場

Well, the leader is Elisa, the coordinator of Erasmus, and she's surprised

when I didn't know her.

But we are like so segregated from this school that we only know our

professors.

艾莉莎是這次的領隊，也是辦公室的召集人，所以我不認識她讓她很驚訝

我們的整個碩班跟這些交換學生是完全分開不同系統的啊

Also I remember a pair of drunken buddies, one Spanish and one Mexican.

  

One Finland guy.

  

Italian girl.

  

我還記得兩個宿醉未醒的大哥

  

一個芬蘭人

  

一個義大利女生

  

And of course the three musketeers!

然後就是我們三個啦！

Crazy selfies in the woods.

各種自拍是當然的

After we reached the top,

山頂風光

And then Ahmed took out a book to read!

  

We just messed around with him and he was so annoyed.

I haven't even use the annoying orange skills!

  

After that, we took another path down and was in Kronberg.

然後我們的阿赫滅得就拿出一本書了⋯

我們當然開始調侃他、鬧他，直到他受不了

  

然後就下山去另外一邊的小鎮

And we went into the castle.

城堡必備的

To be honest it's not really interesting.

  

With one modern art exhibition.

然後其實滿無聊的，沒什麼東西  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bb99c-img_0466.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/db299-img_0466.jpg)

  

And tower.

Garden.

But crazy selfies are always the best!

只好各種自拍

That's kind of end of today, nice and chill.

  

Then we'll go on more city tours.

  

健行就是這樣簡單的一天，我們會去更多的城市觀光囉
