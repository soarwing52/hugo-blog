As I started the course of bouldering in the University,our teacher Esa taught

this monkey a new skill.  

  

And when the semester closes to an end, we arranged one trip to the

Fountainbleau climbing area.  

  

People in our class are Olli, Andreas and me. Esa is unfortunately injured

before the trip, but we beginners got a lot of help from the seniors.

The five days are great weather for March, not too hot, and no rain.  

  

Though the moss are still on some rocks, but for us beginners, it doesn't

really make a difference.  

  

We started everyday shopping in the supermarket, then climb, cook, chat, and

sleep.  

  

Everyday just get our crashpad and go for the rocks!

After that, is the warm up.

After the first day, they made sure that we can manage our beginners group,

then they go for their level!

Here!

I can say this is the coolest thing I did till now in Europe, others are just

not as tough as it should be.

  

But I'm kind of lack of words on this one, because there are more feeling,

balance, experience in this sport, and I'll keep on climbing!

  

A short one, but I guess it's enough.
