So after one night rest, I felt warm and better, let's go to the horn here! We

have all day for this one mountain, have some patience. This whole day will be

sticking with this one and only mountain.

We waited in the house until 10, because we can see it from the balcony,

crazy! Also I'm preserving as much energy as possible We need to walk all the

way cross the town to the station to take the shuttle up.
