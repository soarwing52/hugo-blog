In Interlaken, we start with a photo

We decided to take a more relaxing pace, take pictures whenever its nice we

have all day, and also the scenery is why we are here

the wind is very strong, but in the wrong direction!

so before we go up, first a break

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/56e3f-img_6145.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe814-img_6145.jpg)

I hope we can go straight through the tunnel, but only cars are allowed

time to go up
