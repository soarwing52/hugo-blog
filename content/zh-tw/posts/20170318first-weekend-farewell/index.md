First is to introduce where am I. I'm at Kelsterbach.  

  

This is a town near to the airport, people live here are either old or airport

workers. Some other can't afford house in Frankfurt also lives here.  

  

It's just nearby the river Main, really nice, I enjoy sitting under the sun

and enjoy, write homework, read or just easily take a nap. Unfortunately I

enjoy too much and have no photo here.  

  

我住的這個地方呢，是一個叫做克斯特巴赫的小鎮，鄰近機場，交通機能普普，基本上住這裡的就是老人，或是機場員工，當然後來我知道一個找不到法蘭克福內的房子，只好住到這裡來的人。  

基本上超過六點這裡就完全安靜的像是鬼城，安養天年呀  

  

-我就像是90年代的港劇一樣，中文英文對不起來-  

  

  

Now, it's time to introduce the people in this house.  

  

There's one woman from Switzerland, Susanna  

  

one girl from France, Hélène  

  

one more room changes more frequently, one girl from Taiwan for three days of

exhibition, Kong's coworker, and some other I don't remember  

  

囉哩八嗦到了這裡，該來介紹一個這間房子的住戶啦  

有一位瑞士來的小姐 蘇姍那  

然後是來自法國的 伊蓮那  

然後第三間房間還一直換房客，族繁不及備載  

  

The house owner, Kong. He's brought to Germany from Malaysia as a kid.

Actually his Mandarin is not so good, so I use a mix of bad German and English

to communicate with him. He I would consider kind of typical German man. I'm

very grateful that he helped a lot of my settling down in Germany, gave me a

solid foundation to go further.  

So, since he's Malaysian, who did I get the contact? His wife. She was also

working in flight industry, they met in Singapore airlines. Now they were

married and have a little monster right now.  

Happily ever after.  

  

屋主是來自馬來西亞的先生，不過小時後就來德國，長居德國，基本上個性習慣都算是個德國人，中文不太好，後來發現有些我們聊天有些誤會XDD

例如我想吃當地食物，他聽成了日式料理。  

太太呢，是~~自稱~~ 漂亮人妻，都在機場認識之後呢，現在有個美滿幸福的家庭。

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

So, back to the main theme this weekend, a goodbye.  

  

Hélène is a train engineer, she is doing internship in the DB nearby, and

that's why she rent the house here.  

  

Actually during the week I always saw her arrive home late and just have some

light yogurt and fruit, then she went up stairs. It's nice to always have some

nice little talk, getting back my English tongue, knowing what's life here,

and how's life in Paris. It's a nice thing she's not the typical French, she's

surprisingly open to internationality, broad of thoughts, the Paris in her

eyes are also hard to live, guess engineer education is best at stick to the

truth.  

  

But she's leaving this week, back home. That's why a goodbye came so soon.  

  

On Friday evening, she took me to Eisporthalle, that is a place like circus,

festival, events, stands markets came for a couple of weeks and change place.  

This time, it's an amusement park!

It's really a fun thing, Haven't feel like a child for a long time. Reminds me

of Disneyland.  

Getting to know the city, the culture more from a girl a lot younger than me,

Wow.  

  

伊蓮娜是來自法國巴黎的火車工程師，她來得國實習半年，剛好這個禮拜結束，因此這棟房子新人來，舊人去，江山代有才人出阿。而她完全不像是典型的法國人，對於拒絕使用英文她覺得十分愚蠢，而巴黎也不是一個好城市，一樣工作條件差，人民水準低。這就是工程師教育造成的嗎，太專業了，PH値降低一點就是酸民啦。  

二到四都看她十分晚出現在房子裡，然後簡單吃了點優格+水果，就上樓去了。我住在廚房對面，完全就是一個顧門口XD  

禮拜五下午呢，她帶我去園遊會逛逛這個城市，這裡是採設施制，我們玩了碰碰車、鬼屋、旋轉飛輪，然後吃了法國的經典點心 煎餅  

  

在討論嚴肅議題的時候，她完全不像是20歲，但是在玩耍的時候，大概像是12歲吧。還記得當初在漢堡也去過類似的遊樂設施園遊會，設施依舊，人事全非阿。  

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

On Saturday, she brought me to Mainz, a town nearby. She showed me the castle,

the old wall, and church. Yes, now I know it's the most important element in

all German towns.  

  

禮拜六呢，她帶我去隔壁的另外一個鎮-美茵茲。看了城堡、舊城牆、教堂。德國小鎮三元素，基本上到哪都是這樣... 可是教練，我想玩耍

And for me, I like stupid statues.

And always you get hungry after walking, a nice little snack would be just

great.

Typical wood house

Well, something I found cool is the public bike here. The gears are not in

numbers, but using a graph is really easy for people to understand, nice!  

  

這裡的公共單車，特別的地方是變速，用圖像來表示，瞎子都看的懂阿

After the snack, we came to the riverside. The riverbank park is nice, no

gigantic dike, just close to the river easily. People just easily lay down,

sit down along the river. Enjoy life!  

Well, one thing funny is that today is actually cloudy, but she still got a

little but sunburned. Well, being too white maybe not always a good thing in

this case. Otherwise, everything is really enjoying.  

  

吃了點小點充飢之後，咱們來到河濱公園看看。少了台北那樣的河堤，親水的態度好多了。儘管萊茵河其實船運很多，水不乾淨。但是還是很容易讓人們去親水，在河邊坐臥躺，享受生活。我們也席地而坐，如此慵懶的日子，讓我把初來乍到的緊張感消除不少。

Well, the day ended soon. After we went back home, she need to start packing.  

One thing I must mention here is that she is very good at baking cakes, she

backed one cake as a goodbye gift before she left. Its good, but also bad,

cause need to say goodbye to a new friend in such short time. As a totally new

Frankfurter, it's one hard thing to face. As I think of it now, still hard to

bear. But a toward the next stage of life is always worth celebrating. After

this cake, my life as a master student in Frankfurt, begins.  

  

當然天下無不散的筵席，但是才來一個禮拜就即將跟一位室友說再見，也不是件容易的事阿。逛完了美茵茲，她就需要開始打包啦，而我就準備迎向真正的法蘭碩士生涯。過完這個周末，開始上密集德文班，即將新生活開始。
