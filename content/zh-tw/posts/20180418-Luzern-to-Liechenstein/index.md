So what was our decision of destination for today? It's in the title,

Liechtenstein!! another 135 km and to another country! Are we insane? no

> #### [Relive 'Luzern-

> Liechenstein'](https://www.relive.cc/view/1496496575?r=embed-site)

So we decided to go far out the country, and this made our route cut

Switzerland! The beginning of our day is the hostel breakfast, it's rice! wow

rice cooked by Korean? must be better than the ones I had in Europe But it

failed me. First the lady came and rudely blocked us out of the kitchen and

put the rice we just put into our bowl back into the pot And the taste? super

salty and dry, we need to drink a lot of water

Okay, after the breakfast, let's hit the road

And I found a coin! good start!

We stopped at one house saying Guest House

And they came out and we chatted, Swiss German is hard!

At first we want to go to the city center first, but we are hungry and the

distance is another 25km, so we decided to leave it to the next day

So we are now at a new country, the lady told us the lanes to go tomorrow

and she said that there's a mountain! it's up to 1600m high, my knees are

back, and now its my urge!

so our plan is bike to the boarder with Austria and then come back, get the

stamp, then up the mountain, back to Zurich

Let's go!
