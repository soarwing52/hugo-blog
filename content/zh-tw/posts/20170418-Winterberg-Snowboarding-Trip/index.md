Okay, since my report deadline is March 7 (Wed.) and the German course starts

at March 13(Mon.)  

  

So I got only few days free.  

  

I wanted to do snowboarding so hard, I just find all the information and

planned one trip to Winterberg.  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/250ef-1.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e2fe7-1.jpg)

  

  

  

I asked all the people I know in Frankfurt where to ski,  

  

and even went to the Frankfurt ski club  

  

well, eventually I have to plan a trip of my own,  

  

there was one chance to go at March 5, but my project is not done yet.  

  

So I went with Abhi, cause I can only ask the guys tough enough to handle

themselves when I don't know much about the place we are going.  

  

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

So, the traffic is from Frankfurt Hbf first to Siegen, and then Bad Berleburg,

last bus to Winterberg.  

  

Our semester ticket should be available for the first connection,  

  

though we're not so sure, we went anyway.  

  

So the inspector checked our ticket, and think it's available at the

beginning,  

  

but he came to check twice, and go look up on his manual,  

  

and came the third time and made his call:  

  

"You can only travel to one station before Siegen, so you need to pay for one

station, that is 3.50"  

  

okay, that's the deal.

And we bought the ticket and all the wat to Winterberg.

  

At first we are worried about there's no snow, but as the bus goes,

  

we saw the mountains are white, quite relieved,

  

and more of that, it's a big snowstorm when we arrived!!

A five minute walk made us all white

  

  

After check-in, we want to look some lunch, but there's nothing open, so we

went straight to get the board and start.

  

Now a peak of our room, some basic stuff, nothing much we needed

We bought 3 day ticket for 72 euros, though the first day we start at 14.00

  

So, off we go!

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/f9142-2016_0101_000022_001.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/f8961-2016_0101_000022_001.jpg)

  

After tons of crashes, we met at the beginning point, and it's only one hour!

  

We thought it should be already 5 cause it feels like forever.

  

I stick at the first route to practice, and Abhi said he went to some other

and it's nice.

  

So we went there, and the tragedy awaits

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

After one run I feel pretty good, and we saw one other route, I went to try

it,

  

and that's the last time I saw Abhi.

  

After I came back to where we separated, he's not there,

  

At 4:15, I heard they announced they are closing in 15 minutes, so I kind of

worried

  

I did all the routes we took again and didn't find him.

  

then I went to where we begin, he's not there.

  

I went back to the hotel, also not there

  

At 4:28, I decided to take the last lift to the top to find him.

  

But still he's not there.

  

I just did one last slide down and wait

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3eb6a-2016_0120_080306_001.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/27e49-2016_0120_080306_001.jpg)

Well, it's getting cold, and we didn't bring our phone cause we afraid that

we'll lose it or break it.

  

So I waited until I'm totally frozen and just wrote

  

"Abhi, we met at the hotel"

  

on the snow with the board

  

but the snow is really big and the words are really not so good to recognize

so I wrote it wider.

  

and went back to hotel, and was locked out cause the key is at Abhi's pocket.

  

So I just waited at the door, and it's still snowing

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4715a-img_5934.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/751c7-img_5934.jpg)

  

  

I'm concerned but not worried, cause I know this dude will make his way back

anyway.

  

so around six he finally showed up at the hotel.

  

What happened?

  

"I just took another path and thought it will go back, but they closed the

lift when I was at the other side. I asked them for help, but those

motherfxckers just say no!"

  

"so I have to walk all the way back, and it was snowing like fxck! I even

threw the board cause it is really hard to hike in the snow and it just ran

down the hill so I have to run for it."

  

"I fell like I'm in a snowstorm in the forest, even wonder if there will be

wolf or bears"

  

"At the last mountaintop, I saw the guy going and I went shouting for help to

him, and he took me down the mountain with his snowmobile"

  

This is the memoirs of "the Great adventure of Abhishek"

  

We went green at first, and split at the middle, Abhi went to the red and

walked all the way back

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, the first day we crashed so hard that we got snow everywhere.

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2271a-img_5936.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c3a57-img_5936.jpg)

and we finally settle down and went straight for food first

  

Big Mountain Burger!!

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/f1a54-img_5939.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5df20-img_5939.jpg)

  

The taste is not the best, but it's the best portion to fix our hunger.

  

We almost cried when we eat.

  

After dinner, we went back and shower, fix all the wet clothes

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/6c3e3-img_5942.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/f0299-img_5942.jpg)

  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the second day we had a big breakfast and arrived at 9

  

so keep on the smashing into the snow!

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/419fa-

start.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c8c2b-start.jpg)

  

the weather is still cloudy, but not snowing like yesterday  

  

and I found some downhill place worth coming on summer  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d3e4a-2016_0101_033256_005.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fcee1-2016_0101_033256_005.jpg)

And we took a small break around one hour in the room for lunch( breads from

breakfast)  

  

and then keep on  

  

I'm getting better, I can feel it  

  

At one point the elevator stopped, it's around three  

  

and it stopped so long that I'm afraid if I'll make it or walk back like Abhi

yesterday  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e5c84-2016_0101_050834_002.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fb24c-2016_0101_050834_002.jpg)

  

  

Here's the second episode of falling  

  

[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkVrgIwBE_Y&w=320&h=266]

  

And this day we went further into town for dinner  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/6687a-img_1043.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/35e78-img_1043.jpg)

  

not really good I would say, but we are hungry enough  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

The third day we checked out and put the bags in a room they prepared for all

the skiers in last day  

  

And keep on!  

  

Today I really managed almost every slope, expect for the extreme high and

steep one  

  

I went all the way rolling down it  

  

and the result is pretty nice!  

  

[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B14-mS7bBfg&w=320&h=266]

Nice weather, perfect ending!  

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  

Well, not that perfect.  

  

On our way back, we got serious toe pain  

  

[![](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a45d0-img_5947.jpg)](https://jaythecheyi.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/96aa5-img_5947.jpg)

  

  

My toes are all swollen

But for the fun we had, worth it!
