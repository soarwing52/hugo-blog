Last time I wrote about Rada in the intensive German course, and she showed me

what a Erasmus life is like.  



As we are the three Mensa musketeers, I'm still in the serious German learning

mood, but others are more used to the exchange semester, and enjoying the

summer.



上回提到的拉達同學，是一個專業的艾拉穆拉森學生，在捷克接待很多同學，自己也出來交換。



帶我開啟歐洲學生生涯的大門，比起我認真學德文，他們還在享受暑假模式。



And since I live in Kelsterbach and with no traffic card yet, I didn't join

Rada's various invitations.



But after I finally settled down, got my study chip and live in Frankfurt, I'm

ready for the life in Germany!



先前我還在克森特巴赫住的時候，還沒有學生證，所以沒有辦法出來玩，但是現在終於萬事俱備，東風來碰一個！我來了！



We went on three trips, one studifahren to Luzern and Zürich, one Köln, and

one Heidelberg.



這次要說的是瑞士、科隆、海德堡，一共三篇。

請當成兩種語言的獨立文章，前後不影響的獨立事件。[](https://draft.blogger.com/null)



  

  



The first we went is studifahren. Around one the bus arrived punctuality. And

I slept all the way like dead, though I heard Rada complained about she need

two sits to have a good sleep on a bus. Thank god i don't have the feet of

179cm, I can easily sit. Lol



然後，又是上次去啤酒節的studifahren一點發車，竟然準時抵達！



我當然睡死在車上，不過拉小姐表示她需要躺雙人座，好險我沒有歐洲身高跟很長的腿。



短腿坐廉航也很舒服的概念。



We were waken up at seven for one waterfall. Well, it's said to be the biggest

in Europe, but for an old plain terrain, it's okay.



七點，瀑布。烏來瀑布都比他強。唸在你是一個古老的大陸，就看看吧。

But the weather is raining a little bit and the sun is not up yet, so it's not

so "schön".



  

下車的時候下起大雨，太陽也還沒出來，照片當然很鳥。  

Then the next stop is Luzern, a city said to be like in fairy tales.



What I remember is a clean lake, nice bridge, and a strange lion statue.



  



We walked around, watching the weather getting better.



  



盧森，乾淨的湖水、漂亮的橋，還有一個奇怪的獅子雕像。



網路評語是童話般的城鎮。



但是歐洲童話就是這樣啊，根本跟台灣民間故事的背景到處看都一樣。



我不再吃這套了

Statues are always my favorite



奇怪的雕像，我就是愛亂拍各種雕像

And here is the most famous lion in this city, I really wonder why



創世紀的獅子

they even have chinese here wow!



更上層樓? 中文出現的意義是?

Around noon we went back to the meeting point, with everyone waiting in line

for toilet.



But the guide just rushed everyone back in car. And we lost two girls, just

before we left the city, they called. Too bad we can't see the tragedy, but

still we wasted a lot of time.



  

準備前往蘇黎士的集合時間是中午，大家在停車場的廁所排隊。當然這種時候，一定會有奧客兼三寶的出現。有兩個人沒有來集合，原本我想看好戲，期待他的發生。  

但是沒想到呢，竟然在最後一刻連絡上了，就繞過去載他們，可惜。  

  



Then we arrived Zürich.

At first we got a free city walking tour. It's always nice to get it.



But the only bad thing is that after this, you got nothing to do.  

有兩個小時的市區導覽，當然免費導覽很好，但是逛完之後，就沒東西了，因為重要的都看完了，加上走路很累的XD

The group decide is also a Chaos. Rada don't want to be in the Indian group

because of the smell, but we don't have much choice left, every other group is

kind of full.



She also complained about the time she worked in the Emirate. The man don't

take showers and smells. Kid are so rude to them, treating like servants. The

only good thing is the payment. Or she really don't like the mosque which

wakes her up every day at four. And the culture there.  

  

然後在分組的時候就是一團亂啊，加上印度人948794狂的占了現場的三分之二  

我們的拉小姐提到之前他在阿聯酋的工作經驗，表示中東人都他媽的大男人又不洗澡  

小朋友根本把他們照護當傭人  

但是，為了五斗米折腰阿  

當然印度人不是中東人，他表示印度人最會拖台錢然後用手常常很噁心  

  

當然他後來跟我抱怨把他說的超級種族歧視，其實他是很nice的女性主義者  

而且果然馬上轉頭到車站就很多人表示肚子餓要吃東西  

一半的人遲到，另外一半拿出保鮮盒開始用手吃，沒洗手  

所以儘管難聽，但是是事實

We finished around four, and seen most of the city.



What I remember is nice river, over one thousand drinkable fountain. The city

is quite typical, but clean.



走完這個城市，恩，河流、可以喝的山泉水噴泉，很乾淨，沒有陸客團的摧殘



After that we went to the supermarket, but it's still super expensive, we grab

a beer and keep walking.



當然這裡的物價是超市也貴到昏



Talked about the refugee problem in Poland on a chair at the riverside , which

really caused some issues. And other European problems. Actually I'm not that

good at European history nor geography, so I can't really say anything.



然後聊天內容大概就是波蘭的難民問題，波蘭本身就已經補助不了原本的低收入戶，現在來了難民竟然有優先權  

加上難民們常在大學旁邊垂涎女大生，可惡



After that we walked a little more, and go to a MacDonald for wifi and toilet.

Well one thing I'm tired is this also. For the. Basic needs you need to pay,

and walking around just to wait another toilet to come. Not quite fun.



  



And after that it's not really late, but we went back to the meeting point.



  



Lot of people are already waiting there. Because the night bus is really not a

good sleep, and all the walking, really needs some strength.



  



Before we leave, I found a bush if anyone knows what it's for. Another basic

need.



  



Well, that's quite all for this trip, one more country, two more cities.



  



The next one is Köln.  

  

我個人不喜歡城市旅遊，就是連尿個尿都要錢，然後走來走去之外，什麼都貴  

至於體驗到什麼呢，各人造業個人擔  

  

然後這種夜車旅行團，就是讓人走一半就疲勞，久了變僵屍的窮遊  

以至於我現在都轉向sportsurlaub發展  

  

這次旅行大概就是這樣，下一站，科隆
