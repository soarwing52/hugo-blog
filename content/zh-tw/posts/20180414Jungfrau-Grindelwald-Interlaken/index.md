\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's kind of the tour we made today, I'm starting to do stupid and crazy

things that means I'm feeling healthy again, nice! Release the beaste! And we

switched back our bikes since we don't have hard mountains anymore and my

posts are turning more of a picture gallery, but there's not much to say since

just so tourist nothing big happened in the hostel, a group of Canadian

students came with a "Europe trip" t shirt we arrive everyday late, eat, and

then a bit of IG posting, Facebook, and then we slept. enjoying the ride is

something I can't share with words, only something to feel.
