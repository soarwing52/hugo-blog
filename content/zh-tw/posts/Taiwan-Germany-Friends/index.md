description: "Erasmus, Taiwan, German- New Friends in class"

---



As my intensive German course begins, my life as a student in Germany begins.  

  

In the coming month, I'll get to know lots of cool people and go on cool trips

with them.  

  

Slowly blending into the culture and the city.  

  

隨著德文課的開始，我終於身為一名德國的學生上課啦！  

  

接下來的一個月，即將發生什麼事情呢？  

  

自從踏上人生偉大的航道之後，這裡是新的起點，從以前的黃金梅利號，要變成德國坦克啦

Just like all the great stories, it starts with a sunny, peaceful day.  

就像是每個故事一樣，在很久很久以前  

  

I woke up early and go to the school 30 minutes earlier. Just to found I

waited at the wrong building.  

一個美麗的早晨，我一樣花了快一個小時到學校，提早半小時抵達，卻在最後五分鐘發現等錯樓，4號建築的410，我在1號建築的410  

  

And the first class was so difficult to me, with such a long non-German time,

and the one year of non-IQ in the ROC army, I was idiot at that time,  

第一堂課呀，我完全就像個傻子一樣的一臉矇逼。三年沒有聽過德文了，加上中間一年可是連腦子都沒有用的中華民國國軍，智商大概只剩派大星等級

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Onim_GVXn6k?rel=0]Actually I already

forgot who was there that day, but I still remember one event, and this is the

first time to know the girl who love Taiwan sooooo much more than I do.  

第一天到底有誰呢? 我實在記不清了，不過呢，最重要的是發生了一件意外，讓我知道有人可以這麼愛台灣，而不是~~賣台灣~~  

  

About 40 mins after the class started, one girl stormed in and spoke very

angrily to our Teacher Ioannis, that how she was checked on the bus, and she

just arrived and the study-chip was still at school. The Germans speak almost

no English to her, and said something of "Stupid blondy" And eventually got a

7 euro ticket for forgetting to bring the ticket with her, instead of 60 euro.  

開始上課後大概四十分鐘吧，衝進了一個女生，用憤怒的口氣向老師道歉，說明為什麼會遲到。在公車上被查票員查到，而她說他有學生証，今天開學第一天要去領，但是那些查票員分明聽的懂英文，卻死都不說，只說了幾句"蠢金髮妞"

然後開了7歐元的忘記帶月票，而不是逃票的60歐  

  

And this girl, is Rada.  

來自捷克的拉達小姐

And during the break, we all asked what really happened, cause the storm came

too fast and we care about our classmate.  

  

And the topic changed to which country we are from, we got Poland, Pakistan,

Turkey, India. And Rada is from Czech. She surprised so much when I said I'm

from Taiwan, but I'm more shocked when she said she was in Kaosiung for one

semester! She even still keep a photo in Liohe night market!  

She loved Taiwan so much when Ioannis questioned my nationality, "is ROC

China?"  

  

and who's Ioannis? He's our teacher. He's a Germany born Greek. He got tons of

jokes and got the humor. Though he is often tire and busy, I know why now, he

owns two kneipes and teach in the morning and work in it during the night. But

he's still a really cool guy.  

  

Another great debate is "Either Czech is east Europe or not", he demonstrated

the whole "Germany center" attitude of Germans. But as talking about the whole

communism, polish and czech feels really bad.  

  

下課時間大家都很關心究竟發生了什麼事，畢竟他來的時候說太快，而且大家聽著德文已經腦細胞死一半，憤怒到捷克口音都跑出來的英文確實不好懂。  

  

說清楚之後，大家開始問各自的"祖國"，波蘭、巴基斯坦、土耳其、然後當然這裡滿地的印度人。拉達小姐來自捷克，而聽到台灣呢，她雀躍萬分呀！因為他到高雄交換過一個學期，甚至還留著一張六合夜市的拍立得在皮包裡呢！當亞尼斯問，為什麼你的國家名稱有中國，你們到底是不是中國的問題的時候，她很強勢的為台灣辯護  

  

而亞尼斯是誰呢？就是我們的德文老師囉，希臘血統，德國成長，卻有著德國人沒有的幽默感。他上課常常很疲倦，又有些外務，因為他經營著兩家小酒館，白天教德文晚上顧店。但是上課還是很不錯的阿！  

  

他有時候會故意問敏感問題，像是剛剛的台灣中國問題，還有另外一個"捷克是不是東歐"。完全就是一個德國中心主義的完美展現阿！而在前蘇維埃政權前提到共產或是左派有多好的時候，當然波蘭的朋友們強烈反對阿。當然德國自己的政治問題他也有說，像是類似納粹極右派政黨正在慢慢復闢，而我對他提問希特勒回來了這部電影呢，他則嚴肅的表示，這一點也不好笑，人們應該懼怕、戒慎恐懼這段歷史，而不是當作玩笑，時時都要避免重蹈覆轍  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

enough of the bias, let's introduce some more guys!  

當然，各種政治不正確到此為止，來看看其他人吧

This is Ahmed, in the class, he's the one answers "darum" when questions of

German have no answer.  

  

But is it another bad joke? cause it sounds just like "durum doner" even

though he said this first.  

  

at the next month, we are like the three musketeers of Mensa, lunch together.  

  

He's more of a quiet guy and chill.  

  

來自土耳其的阿赫滅德，沉默寡言，英文不太好，有機器人的語調。基本上我們就是午餐三人眾啦  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

And we had Gözde, another hard-working Turkish girl.  

哥自德，土耳其認真型女孩，來念電腦碩士  

  

The Polish three: Adrianna, Orga, Dominica. Pardon me if I spell it wrong, it

was too long ago.  

三位波蘭小姐，基本上就是波蘭語迅速溝通他們舌頭還真的不是普通的快，可惡阿斯  

  

Pakistan soccer buddies who always watch games too late and late for class.  

巴基斯坦兄弟，每次都說熬夜看球遲到，大哥，我來德國看德甲西甲英超根本完美時間  

  

Ottma comes from Mexico, also a cool guy but I'd never get the chance to hang

out and know this guy.  

奧特馬，跟歐巴馬沒關係，他也不是黑人不用閉嘴

Tamara, the Jordanian who went to a trip and never come back to class again.  

他馬拉，約旦女孩，去旅遊之後再也沒有出現過  

  

Jae-Yon, she's from Korea, the only other East-Asian in the class, but not the

typical Korean. Instead of joining the A1.1 Korean big pack, she's a lone

ranger, she was here for a long time and also went for something more than

German in the classroom.  

余在研，韓國女孩，但非典型。在初級班有一群像是少女時代+BIGBANG的韓國男女混和團體，不過他沒跟那些交換生一起來，沒有一起混，而是在這裡有個很充實的人生  

  

Noman, a relatively old man, around thirty something or more. He's in her for

7 years, but never taken any proper German class, so he wants to start from

the basic grammar.  

諾曼，不是大登陸。一個成年巴基斯坦男性，已經在德國七年了，學的馬路德語，因此現在補齊文法  

  

Duy and Huang, young Vietnamese. 21 and starting to know Europe. Duy end up

every week drinking in Ioannis kneipe.  

兩個越南人，21歲小朋友，真的普遍害羞內向，不善與其他人溝通交流，最後杜伊更是每周到老師的酒館報到，就沒有去其他地方了，可惜

At the last week, school got budget to give us a free tour in the Dialog

Museum, a museum to experience how it is to be blind.  

學校補助一次的戶外教學，我們去了盲人體驗博物館，在全黑的環境裡面有自然、城市、馬路等環境體驗，最後在黑暗中酒吧嘗試點餐。  

  

These are the classmates, but not all.  

以上，族繁不及備載  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

That's the German class, we'll go to many more trips and have much more fun.

The coming semester we still keep in touch. But the erasmus nature is change

and moving, so one semester of friendship, and then we'll meet each other in

the other place and other time in the world!  

  

這就是我們班啦，主要的學生來自[伊拉斯謨計劃](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-

hant/%E4%BC%8A%E6%8B%89%E6%96%AF%E8%AC%A8%E8%A8%88%E5%8A%83)，就是周遊列國，只少了那麼一個拄著拐杖的至聖先師帶領，各自飄揚，一個個學期的交換，認識新朋友然後分離，完全就是常態。因此一個學期內，我們玩耍了不少地方，下個學期，就各奔東西囉！
