ESRI now provides various resources and templates for users for spatial usage



  



And as how to connect data to people is one important part, and our project is

to create a system, where users can submit their comments about ourplannings.



  



So, Geoform and Crowd source reporter is tested, and here are some experiences

and tipps.



  



Geoform



  



It is relatively easy. but in the creation theres many ways, from csv, or

build the GUID relation with Arcmap. My limit is that with Basic license can't

create the full funciton, and csv can't make domain or reject null value.



  



  



One convenient method is create with Survey123, which will also take the

benefit of the analyze panel in it.



  



My method is to create the fields in Arcmap, then upload the feature layer,

then activate attachments, this is the easiest way to create feature ready for

Geoform.

With Feature ready, Webmap created, simply generate App from templates. Follow

the instructions and test out a bit, the tip is that the setting of the Survey

lies in the pop up of the Webmap

Crowd Source Reporter



  



this is a bit more complicated, with simple creation can't create an available

app.



  



first need to create a group and share the feature layer and Webmap

Click share as, create Web-App, then the Crowdsource Reporter can be created.

the functions are quite straight forward, if theres a number field the twitter

heart can be added to it



and also the comments on one field.



  



As in the previous article, it is rejected for the size of the panel and the

lack of widgets.



Or else this view and function is quite interesting for users.



  



And all the fields are all edited in the pop-ups.

When I was looking for crowdsource reporter related sources, there aren't

many, only one video helped me,:

Actually the main thing is to create a group and put everything in it



  



the rest is to edit the pop-ups in the editable layer.



  



first I used the layer fieldworker from Survey123, later I created own layers

as in the[ Smart Editor ](https://soarwing52.blogspot.com/2019/08/using-smart-

editor-to-create-survey.html)



  



The limitation of these two is that only point data is supported.



  



With Smart Editor it is the final choice, with less change to the original

format of the app, with only one new widget.



  



But the App-templates can have more functions, and also if JavaScript ability

is included, it can be more creative and hosted more freely.
